# Setup k8s config:
# kubeApiServerAddress is default to ${KUBE_APISERVER_ADDRESS} and kubeConfigFilePath
# is default to ${KUBECONFIG} then falls back to ${HOME}/.kube/config.
# If both kubeApiServerAddress and kubeConfigFilePath after defaulting are still empty,
# falls back to k8s inClusterConfig.

# Address should be in format http[s]://host:port
#kubeApiServerAddress: http://10.10.10.10:8080
